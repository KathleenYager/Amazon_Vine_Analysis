Amazon Vine program members request a review specific to toy purchases that analyzes percentages of 5 star rating submitted by vine and non-vine reviewers.

## Results: 
The dataset used for the analyses includes 65,871 reviews. Of the total count of reviews 28,453 received a 5 star rating. Of the total 5 star rated toys reviewed: 
	- 1.5% (N=410) of 5 star rated reviews are Vine reviews. 
	_ 98.5%(N=28,043) of 5 star rated reviews are non-Vine 	   	  reviews. 

5 star rated reviews account for about 43% of all reviews completed.  


## Summary: 
The scope of this project only considers 5 star ratings. Analysts may support Vine members by calcualting the each rating level to better understand the impact and benefit of maintaining a Vine membership. 

Vine members may want to consider the information included in each review to determine if they receive additional insight from paid Vine reviews in comparison to information include in non-paid reviews.

Members may also benefit from comparing all rated "helpful votes" made by Vine reviewers compared to "helpful votes" made by all non paid reviewers. This analysis may support Vine members in understanding benefits to paid membership. The image above shows the first 20 rows of a dataset that includes both Vine and Helpful vote columns. It suggests that not all Vine membership reviews are helpful reviews. With more exploration Vine members may discern that they can gather data about toys through free sources.
